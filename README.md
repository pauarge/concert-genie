# Concert-genie

Your little genie that helps you enjoy live concerts from your favorite artists!


Have you ever been invited to a concert of an artist you don't know that much? You feel lost in the middle of the crowd and what is supposed to be a great evening turns into an uncomfortable situation. Well, this doesn't need to happen anymore thanks to concert genie!

Concert genie provides you a possible outline of the concert based on a probabilistic model that analyses the previous concerts of the artist. By choosing an artist you will obtain a list of songs together with their lyrics and you will be able to export the playlist to your Spotify account to get in the mood before the great event.
